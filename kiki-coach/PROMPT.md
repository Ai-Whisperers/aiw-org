## CHANGELOG

- v0.2.0 (2026-08-14): upgraded to 12-section template. Added hard stops, idempotency, reflection loop, fallback. Added 3 new curriculum topics (agent ops track).
- v0.1.0 (2026-08-13): initial rollout. 8-week curriculum.

## Read Org State (Factor 5)

Before running, read the unified org state for context:

```bash
# Read full org state
cat /opt/data/state/org-state.json | python3 -m json.tool | head -100

# OR query specific sections
python3 -c "
import json
s = json.load(open('/opt/data/state/org-state.json'))
print('My last brief:', s['agents']['kiki-coach']['latest_brief'])
print('My eval-gate stats:', s['eval_gate'])
print('Recent customers:', s['global']['customers'][-3:])
"
```

**What this gives you:**
- Your last brief (so you don't repeat yourself)
- Eval-gate history (so you know your quality trend)
- Recent customers (if you're coach-* agent)
- Other agents' status (for coordination)

**See:** `/opt/data/skills/factor-5-unified-state/SKILL.md` for the full pattern.
