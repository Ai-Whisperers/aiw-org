# AGENTS.md — AIW Org (aiw-org)

> **The single authoritative collaboration rulebook for all coding agents working in this org.**
> Applies to: Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Windsurf, Kimi, OpenClaw, Hermes, and any other vendor.
> Vendor-specific files (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md` per repo) are pointers to this doc.
> **Conflicts are resolved in favor of this file.**

## Before starting work — three required steps

1. **Read in fixed order:**
   - `README*` (any language)
   - This `AGENTS.md`
   - `docs/HANDOFF.md` (current state of work)
   - `docs/adr/` (architectural decisions)
   - `git log -10 --oneline` (recent history)

2. **Run the verification command for the project** (see "Verification commands" below).
   - **If baseline is red → fix baseline FIRST. Never stack new changes on a red baseline.**

3. **Restate the current task and acceptance criteria in your own words**, confirm alignment with HANDOFF before touching code.

---

## Before declaring work done — three required steps

1. **Run the FULL verification command**, confirm all green.
2. **Update `docs/HANDOFF.md`**: current goal / completed / in-progress (with file paths and locations) / known pitfalls / next steps / how to verify.
3. **Commit git**: no uncommitted half-finished work; commit message uses Conventional Commits and explains WHY not just WHAT.

---

## Verification commands (canonical baseline)

For Python projects in this org (most agents and scripts):
```bash
cd /opt/data/agents && bash tests/run-all.sh
```

Expected output:
- `=== Lint PROMPTs ===` (passes)
- `=== Validate state ===` (passes)
- `=== Run unit tests ===` (e.g. `210 passed`)
- `Total failures: 0`

For Python module changes specifically:
```bash
cd /opt/data/agents && /opt/data/.venv/bin/python3 -m pytest tests/<changed_module>.py -v
```

For Hermes skill/plugin changes:
```bash
/opt/hermes/bin/hermes skills list        # confirm enabled
/opt/hermes/bin/hermes plugins list       # confirm enabled
```

**If the verification command changes, update this section in the same commit.**

---

## Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

- **Any "why this change" decision** for architecture / approach / schema changes goes in `docs/adr/`.
- Format: see `docs/adr/0000-template.md`.
- **Decisions only in chat = decisions that didn't happen.** Write them down.

---

## Enterprise framework governance

Framework models, terminology, and review gates follow [`docs/enterprise-framework/GOVERNANCE.md`](docs/enterprise-framework/GOVERNANCE.md). Canonical gate index: [`docs/enterprise-framework/APPROVALS.md`](docs/enterprise-framework/APPROVALS.md).

**Before changing core entities:**

1. **Terminology-first** — add or update terms in `docs/terminology/TERMS.md` before schemas, prompts, or tickets.
2. **ADR for breaking changes** — entity, relationship, or enumeration changes that break consumers require an ADR in `docs/adr/`.
3. **Migration notes** — when an approved schema version changes, document what consumers must update.
4. **Human authority** — changes to approvers or sign-off rules need a dated review gate, not a silent edit.

**Forbidden:** Calling a model `locked`, `complete`, or `approved` while its gate in APPROVALS.md is still `proposed`. AI-generated approval summaries are not evidence of human sign-off.

---

## Git discipline

- **Forbidden: `git add -A`** — use `git add -u` or per-file `git add <path>`. New files must be explicitly added.
- Before commit, `git diff --stat` to verify no surprise changes to `Dockerfile`, `nginx.conf`, `docker-compose.yml`, etc. Infrastructure files in separate commits.
- Small commits. One commit = one change. One task = one branch.
- Branch names: `feat/<short-name>`, `fix/<short-name>`, `chore/<short-name>`. No special chars.

---

## Anti-patterns (forbidden)

- ❌ Putting critical context in vendor-private directories (`.claude/`, `.cursor/`, `.codex/`)
- ❌ Relying on conversation summaries / context compression to pass state between sessions
- ❌ Stacking new features on a red test baseline
- ❌ Tackling tasks larger than "can be explained in half a day" before handoff
- ❌ Claiming "Done!" or "All tests pass" without FRESH verification evidence in the same response
- ❌ Trusting agent success reports without independent VCS diff verification
- ❌ Leaving uncommitted work at session end

## Engineering principles

- **Don't preserve backward compat:** delete obsolete paths, don't add compat shims, fallbacks, or migration code.
- **Choose the simplest implementation that fully meets current needs.** Avoid speculative abstractions, config, and indirection layers.
- **Layered evolution:** start with a working end-to-end minimum, then layer new capabilities on top. Never replace a working product with half-finished complexity.
- **Modular components, clear separation of concerns.**
- **Prefer mature, well-maintained libraries** (when they reduce overall complexity or improve reliability). Don't reinvent common functionality without a reason.
- **Use existing project dependencies first.** Don't assume a library lacks a capability — check docs and types first.
- **Architecture decisions are long-term.** No "works now, definitely replace later" temporary solutions.
- **Conflict resolution:** architectural boundaries follow long-term design; implementation within boundaries follows current simplest.

## Handoff boundary integrity (ADR-0003)

**Every handoff between agents MUST:**
- Include an explicit `Audience:` header listing who can read it
- Include an explicit `Visibility:` scope (`internal` | `dept-scoped:<id>` | `agent-scoped:<id>` | `public`)
- Be full-text — **NEVER auto-summarize** handoff artifacts. Compressed handoffs lose boundary metadata at 73% leakage rate (per arXiv 2026).
- Go through `pre_dispatch_check` validation before writing

**Rationale:** "Facts Without Rules: Boundary Metadata Collapse in Multi-Agent LLM Handoffs" (arXiv 2026) measured 73% privacy leakage when handoffs are compressed to ≤25 words. AIW's full-text markdown outbox preserves boundaries; this rule prevents future contributors from accidentally introducing compression. See `/opt/data/agents/docs/adr/0003-handoff-boundary-integrity.md`.

## Safety red lines

- **NEVER commit secrets, credentials, IDs, or customer PII.** If you find existing secrets in a repo, **report and stop — do not silently fix.**
- **NEVER push to a remote without explicit authorization** (this org uses `github-push-from-bws` wrapper; raw `git push` blocked by safety hook).
- **NEVER print token-shaped strings to chat** (token-leak failure mode). If a token appears in chat, treat as compromised, rotate in BWS.
- **NEVER modify `state/coord.json` directly** — go through the AIW agent that owns that signal.
- **NEVER add a new cron job without an entry in `/opt/data/agents/ORCHESTRATION.md`** explaining its purpose and SLA.
